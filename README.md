# Uber Minimum Wage Calculator

A Laravel-based web application that calculates minimum wage for Uber drivers across Canadian provinces, with special support for Ontario's Digital Platform Workers' Rights Act.

## üöó Features

- **Province-based minimum wage calculation** for all Canadian provinces/territories
- **Ontario Digital Platform Workers' Rights Act** support ($17.20/hour minimum)
- **IP-based province detection** for automatic location selection
- **Time format support** (Hours:Minutes - e.g., 8:30)
- **Net fare and tips integration** for complete earnings calculation
- **Uber API integration** for automatic data import (optional)
- **Responsive Uber-style UI** with clean, professional design

## üìä Calculation Formula

1. **Minimum Wage = Active Time √ó Hourly Rate**
2. **Hour Total = Minimum Wage - Net Fare** (amount owed to driver)
3. **Total Earnings = Hour Total + Net Fare + Tips**

The "Hour Total" represents the minimum wage top-up that platforms must pay drivers under the Digital Platform Workers' Rights Act.

## üîå Uber API Integration (Optional)

### Setting up Uber Developer Account

‚ö†Ô∏è **Important:** The current Uber API credentials in the code are invalid/demo credentials. To enable real Uber integration, you need to:

1. **Register as Uber Developer**
   - Go to [Uber Developer Portal](https://developer.uber.com/)
   - Create an account and verify your identity
   - Apply for API access (may require business verification)

2. **Create an Application**
   - Create a new app in the developer dashboard
   - Set your redirect URI to: `http://your-domain.com/uber/callback`
   - Note down your Client ID and Client Secret

3. **Configure Environment Variables**
```bash
# Add to .env file
UBER_CLIENT_ID=your_actual_client_id
UBER_CLIENT_SECRET=your_actual_client_secret
```

4. **Request Appropriate Scopes**
   - `partner.trips` - For trip data access
   - `partner.payments` - For earnings data access
   - May require special approval from Uber

### API Limitations

- **Access Restrictions:** Uber limits API access to verified partners
- **Scope Requirements:** Trip and payment data requires special permissions
- **Rate Limits:** API calls are limited per application
- **Data Privacy:** Subject to Uber's data usage policies

### Alternative Solutions

If official API access isn't available:

1. **Manual CSV Import** (recommended)
   - Drivers export earnings from Uber Driver app
   - Upload CSV files to the calculator
   - Automatic parsing and calculation

2. **Manual Data Entry** (current default)
   - Drivers enter active time, net fare, and tips manually
   - Still provides accurate minimum wage calculations
